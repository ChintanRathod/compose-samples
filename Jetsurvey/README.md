## Uniflow ðŸ¦„

All ViewModels are extending the `AndroidDataFlow` type, to use the Uniflow API.

Setup:
- Setup Uniflow to log events/states [`MainActivity`][2]

Events & Navigation: [WelcomeViewModel][5],[SignInViewModel][6],[SignUpViewModel][7]
- Navigation events are send as `NavigationEvent`.
- Fragments listening to events are using `onEvents`

States Flow: [SurveyViewModel][8]
- emits states to be rendered to Compose. Just need to use the `states` from `AndroidDataFlow`, in `SurveyFragment`
- uses `actionOn` guards, to run action on given state
- Fragment listening to events are using `states` property

Tests samples: [Tests][9]

## Features

This sample contains several screens: a welcome screen, where the user can enter their email, sign in and sign up screens and a survey screen. The app has light and dark themes.

### App scaffolding

Package [`com.example.compose.jetsurvey`][1]

[`MainActivity`][2] is the application's entry point. Each screen is implemented inside a `Fragment` and [`MainActivity`][2] is the host `Activity` for all of the `Fragment`s.
The navigation between them uses the [Navigation library][3]. The screens and the navigation are defined in [`Navigation.kt`][4]

### Sign in/sign up

Package [`com.example.compose.jetsurvey.signinsignup`][5]

This package contains 3 screens:
* Welcome
* Sign in
* Sign up

To get to the sign up screen, enter an email that contains "signup".
These screens show how to create different custom composable functions, reused them across multiple screens and handle UI state.

See how to:

* Use `TextField`s
* Implement `TextField` validation across one `TextField` (e.g. email validation) and across multiple `TextFields` (e.g. password confirmation)
* Use a `Snackbar`
* Use different types of `Button`s: `TextButton`, `OutlinedButton` and `Button`

### Complete a survey

Package [`com.example.compose.jetsurvey.survey`][6]

This screen allows the user to fill out a survey, showing how to handle complex state. UI state is kept and restored on recompositions triggered by different reasons like a configuration change or a new question being displayed on the screen.

See how to:

* Use `RadioButton`s - for single item selection
* Use `Checkbox`es - for multi-item selection
* Use `Slider` - for picking a value from a range
* Use `Scaffold` - for screens with top bar, bottom bar and body
* Display a `DialogFragment` when requested from compose
